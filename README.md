# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

We will be analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

In this project we have selected a database for Pet Products to analyze. We will use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. 
Next, weâ€™ll use PySpark to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the dataset. 

## Results

We are trying to answer these questions from the database for the Pet Product Reviews:

## Summary: 
There are significantlly more reviews from customers that are not in the Vine program 37,840 vs 170. out of those 37k 54.5% of the reviews were 5 stars, this means that the customers did not receive any form of compensation for their review and they were pleased with their pet product. In contrast, 65 out of the 170 reviews in the program were 5 stars. This is about 38% of the reviewers who were compensated for their reviews rated the product 5 stars. 

Since the there are 16% more 5 star review in the non Vine reviews we can conclude that there is not positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. 

Additionally we could analyze the dataset to show that these were verified purchases and not just reviews that were left. This could help prove that the people who actually purchased the product were the ones leaving the reviews.
